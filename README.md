# Details
## Deliverables
* A rails app repo with:
  * Rails 4.2.4
  * Functioning db/seed.rb
* A link to a live Heroku instance


## Requirements
* Reddit is "User-generated news links. Votes promote stories to the front page."

## Difficult Mode
* Clicking "DOWN" should create a negative vote
* Add a `User` who `has_many` links
* When submitting a link, allow user to select themselves in a drop down

## Epic Mode
* Make the user sign in using `Devise` or similar
* Add Controller testing and Acceptance testing to verify a user clicking a link creates the votes you expect

## Notes
* To launch on heroku, you'll need the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) and a [Heroku Account](https://signup.heroku.com/login)
